# CAR (CCOLAR)  
Developement of an indexing model for AI using a hybrid methodology to: 
Categorize data by assigning categories and using a hierarchical approach.
Catalog sessions by storing them in a database with metadata and tags for reference.
Organize sessions through a structured hierarchy with main subjects, subsubjects, and tags.
Label sessions using tags and categories for easy identification and retrieval.
Archive sessions implicitly by their storage in a database, which can be designed to keep historical or old data accessible.
Retrieve AI session data via a search functionality that can filter through categories, tags, and metadata, respecting user-level permissions.
